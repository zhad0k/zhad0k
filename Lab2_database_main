Task 1

П ID, person_name (employee ⋈ (σ company_name = "BigBank"(works))

 

П ID, person_name, city(employee ⋈ (σ company_name = 'BigBank'(works))

 

П ID, person_name, street, city(σ company_name = "BigBank" " ∧  salary > $10000 (employee × works))

 

П ID, person_name(employee ⋈ works ⋈ company=city) ))

 

Task 2

П ID, person_name (employee ⋈ company_name ≠ "BigBank"(employee × works))

 

П ID, person_name (works) − (П person_name (works ⋈ (1.salary ≤ 2.salary ∧ 2.company = 'BigBank')

 

Task 3

Inserting a tuple: (ID,name,dept_name,salary)

Inserting a tuple: (22222, Einstein, Physics, 95000)

If the instructor will be the child for department table for the dept_name attribute,so in this case we can't 
add to the instructor table if it's not exist ,so it gives a mistake.And if we will add physics as dept_name 
to the instructor table which isn't in department table,so it'll give the violation of foreign key constraint.

Deleting the tuple:( ID,name,dept_name,tot_cred)

Deleting the tuple:(12121,Finance, Wu, 90000)
So here is problem,if we will delete from the department table something is present in instructor table,
it will give error.So we can't delete from the department table Finance and if instructor table contains
that one so it will the give the violation of foreign key constraint.
